# LangChainExamples

[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
- Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
- Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The LangChain framework is designed around these principles. This repository is to explore the usage of Langchain in different scenarios.
```
